See [[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/birch-beer]] for latest version.

* Description

[[file:img/piechart_pruned_tree.png]]

=birch-beer= is all about sweet trees. That is, visualizing hierarchical
structures where the elements are stored in leaves and parent nodes represent
all of the descendant leaves. Using branch scaling, weighted average color
blending, distance markers, and more, we can all create some home brewed
=birch-beer= together!

* Installation

** Use =nix=

Installing =birch-beer= using =nix= is the easiest way to install from source.
First, install =nix= following the instructions
[[https://nixos.org/nix/][on the website]]. Then run the commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/birch-beer.git
cd birch-beer
nix-env -f default.nix -i birch-beer
#+END_SRC

Then the =birch-beer= command should be in your path! If you do not wish to use
=nix= or =docker=, then you can continue reading for dependencies and =stack=
installation (no longer supported).

** Dependencies

You may require the following dependencies to build and run (from Ubuntu 16.04,
use the appropriate packages from your distribution of choice):

- build-essential
- libgmp-dev
- libblas-dev
- liblapack-dev
- libgsl-dev
- libgtk2.0-dev
- libcairo2-dev
- libpango1.0-dev
- graphviz

** Install =stack=

See [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/]] for more details.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
stack setup
#+END_SRC

** Install =birch-beer=

*** Source

Probably the easiest method if you don't want to mess with dependencies (outside
of the ones above).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/birch-beer.git
cd birch-beer
stack install
#+END_SRC

*** Online

We only require =stack= (or =cabal=), you do not need to download any source
code (but you might need the stack.yaml dependency versions), just run the
following command to place =birch-beer= in your =~/.local/bin/=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack install birch-beer
#+END_SRC

If you run into errors like =Error: While constructing the build plan, the
following exceptions were encountered:=, then follow it's advice. Usually you
just need to follow the suggestion and add the dependencies to the specified
file. For a quick =yaml= configuration, refer to
[[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/birch-beer/blob/master/stack.yaml]]. Relies on
=eigen-3.3.4.1= right now.

*** Docker

Different computers have different setups, operating systems, and repositories.
Do put the entire program in a container to bypass difficulties (with the other
methods above), we user =docker=. So first, [[https://docs.docker.com/][install docker]].

To get =birch-beer= (replace 0.1.0.0 with [[https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/gregoryschwartz/birch-beer/general][any version needed]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker pull gregoryschwartz/birch-beer:0.1.0.0
#+END_SRC

To run =birch-beer= in a docker container:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo docker run gregoryschwartz/birch-beer:0.1.0.0 -h
#+END_SRC

To build the =birch-beer= image yourself if you want:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/birch-beer.git
cd birch-beer
docker build -t birch-beer -f ./Dockerfile .
#+END_SRC

* Usage

*For a more detailed look at many of the features*, check out the
=too-many-cells= [[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells][README]] about =make-tree=, which uses =birch-beer= to plot
single cell clades with examples. At any point, use =birch-beer -h= to see the
help. The general usage would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
birch-beer --input tree.json --labels-file labels.csv
#+END_SRC

** Tree format

The input tree format should be a =json= file with a recursive structure. An
object is represented by =[{"_distance": DOUBLE, "_item": [STRING]},
[SUBFOREST]]=, where ="_distance"= and ="_item"= are optional (otherwise use
={}=), having ="_distance"= for inner nodes and ="_item"= for leaves. Supports
rose trees as well! For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[{"_distance": 0.8}, [[{"_item": ["1", "2"]}, [[{"_item": ["3", "4", "5"]}, []], [{"_item": ["6", "7"]}, []]]], [{"_item": ["8", "9", "10", "11"]}, []]]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Example conversion from R

To get to the required format, here is an example to get from an R =hclust= tree
to the appropriate =json=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(dendextend)
library(data.tree)
library(jsonlite)

# Get hclust tree.
hc = hclust(dist(USArrests), "ave")
# Get dendrogram.
dend = as.dendrogram(hc)
# Get nicely formatted tree from dendrogram.
tree = as.Node(dend)
# Convert to JSON
json = toJSON(as.list(tree, mode = "explicit", unname = TRUE))
# Write to file
cat(json, file = "tree.json")
#+END_SRC

Saving this file as =tree.json=, we continue to format as such (this could be a
single command, but was split to make clearer). Here, we use
[[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][ =jq= ]], the command line =json= processor.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cat tree.json \
    | jq -c 'walk( if (type == "object") then (if (has("leaf") | not) then del(.name) else . end) else . end)' \
    | jq -c 'walk( if (type == "object") then del(.members) | del(.midpoint) | del(.value) | del(.plotHeight) else . end)' \
    | jq -c 'walk( if (type == "object") then (if (has("leaf")) then ._item = .name | del(.name) else . end) else . end)' \
    | jq -c 'walk( if (type == "object") then (if (has("leaf") | not) then [{}, [.children[]]] else . end) else . end)' \
    | jq -c 'walk( if (type == "object") then (if (has("leaf")) then [{_item}, []] else . end) else . end)' \
    > formatted_tree.json
#+END_SRC

Then we can see the tree using birch-beer.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
birch-beer -i formatted_tree.json
#+END_SRC

** Labels format

To assign labels (and thus colors) to the elements within the tree, make a =csv=
file with an =item,label= format. Both columns are treated as strings, so
anything can be used as long as the =item= column matches the item strings in
the tree. For example to go with the above tree:

#+CAPTION: labels.csv
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
item,label
1,1
2,1
3,2
4,2
5,2
6,3
7,1
8,1
9,3
10,3
11,2
#+END_EXAMPLE
