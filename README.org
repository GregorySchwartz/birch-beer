* Description

[[file:img/piechart_pruned_tree.png]]

=birch-beer= is all about sweet trees. That is, visualizing hierarchical
structures where the elements are stored in leaves and parent nodes represent
all of the descendant leaves. Using branch scaling, weighted average color
blending, distance markers, and more, we can all create some home brewed
=birch-beer= together!

* Installation

** Dependencies

You may require the following dependencies to build and run (from Ubuntu 16.04,
use the appropriate packages from your distribution of choice):

- build-essential
- libgmp-dev
- libblas-dev
- liblapack-dev
- libgsl-dev
- libgtk2.0-dev
- libcairo2-dev
- libpango1.0-dev
- graphviz

** Install =stack=

See [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/]] for more details.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
stack setup
#+END_SRC

** Install =birch-beer=

*** Online

We only require =stack= (or =cabal=), you do not need to download any source
code, just run the following command to place =birch-beer= in your
=~/.local/bin/=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack install birch-beer
#+END_SRC

*** Source

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack install
#+END_SRC

* Usage

*For a more detailed look at many of the features*, check out the
=too-many-cells= [[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells][README]] about =make-tree=, which uses =birch-beer= to plot
single cell clades with examples. At any point, use =birch-beer -h= to see the
help. The general usage would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
birch-beer --input tree.json --labels-file labels.csv
#+END_SRC

** Tree format

The input tree format should be a =json= file with a recursive structure. An
object is represented by
=[{"_distance": DOUBLE, "_item": [STRING]}, [SUBFOREST]]=, where ="_distance"=
and ="_item"= are optional, usually, having ="_distance"= for inner nodes and
="_item"= for leaves. Supports rose trees as well! For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[{"_distance": 0.8}, [[{"_item": ["1", "2"]}, [[{"_item": ["3", "4", "5"]}, []], [{"_item": ["6", "7"]}, []]]], [{"_item": ["8", "9", "10", "11"]}, []]]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Labels format

To assign labels (and thus colors) to the elements within the tree, make a =csv=
file with an =item,label= format. Both columns are treated as strings, so
anything can be used as long as the =item= column matches the item strings in
the tree. For example to go with the above tree:

#+CAPTION: labels.csv
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
item,label
1,1
2,1
3,2
4,2
5,2
6,3
7,1
8,1
9,3
10,3
11,2
#+END_EXAMPLE
